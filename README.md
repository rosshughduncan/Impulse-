This project is a musical step sequencer program designed to be used with a Novation Impulse MIDI keyboard controller.
It works with a program called Aserve, which was a synthesiser written using the JUCE audio framework, which we used at university to test our programs.

The user can store up to 5 sequences, which each contain 5 layers. Each step in the sequence can be selected to use either a sine, square or saw wave.
The user can transpose layers or change the tempo of the sequence.

The design rationale and flowchart is shown in the flowchart.pdf file. The source code, written in C, is demonstrated in the program.rtf file.

This project was created during the first year of the programming module of my Audio and Music Technology course at university. This project gained the highest marks in the year group and was demonstrated to the class as being an excellent piece of work.
